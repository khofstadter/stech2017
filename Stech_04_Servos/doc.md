## Servo

* maxToArduino4Servo_0.1

1) Only works with old Arduino IDE (023). Doesnâ€™t work with new Ard v1.0 or newer. (library read problems). 
2) You need to install the megaservo librarie in your documents/arduino folder. 

Previous Arduino versions [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases). 

Also you might want to look into using capacitors and resistors if the servo is not made to operate on 5V (arduino operates on 5V if connected to PC).
